Tasks:
• Always enable VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation
• Get rid of "Debug" config. Only Release from now onwards
• Only support 1 Camera
• Proper Frame Fencing
    • Should only stall CPU before the FIRST command buffer submission
• Oct-tree culling on CPU
    • Practically mandatory. Uploading the entire scene's worth of instance transforms every frame cannot scale up.
    • Same for Directional Light Shadow pass
    • Cull objects ONCE per view-proj (Should only be 2. Camera & Dir Light), then re-use culled lists of objects in all Renderers
• Don't clear GBuffer every frame
    • Your game should have every pixel in every GBuffer Render Target filled up.
• Encapsulate as many Vulkan API calls as possible inside your "CommandList" class
• Implement Full Z-PrePass
    • Treat every Opaque object as an occluder
• Multi-thread all Graphic Tasks & Renderers
    • Implement free-list of command buffers. They must all be properly fenced before re-used
• Render Graph
    • Resource state transitions
    • Resource Lifetime & Aliasing
    • Frame Volatile & Persistent Resources
